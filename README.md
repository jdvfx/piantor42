# Piantor 42 keys layout (QWERTY)

Goal:
- keep the layout as standard as possible, making it easy to switch between the Piantorand a fullsize or laptop keyboard.
- remove duplicated keys (almost done)
- move F keys on a layer. Realistically, I only ever use F1.

- arrow in Vim position (hjkl)

- brackets are in logical priority order: (){}[]
function(){
    array[]
}

"delete" is a combo, much safer than a single key press.

- keys in same position as a standard layout:
bottom to top: ctr, shift, tab 
left to right: crtl, super, space
top row: numbers and corresponding symbols 
backspace and enter
3 keys on the right side of "M"

- to do:
add "insert" key? used very rarely in 2 softwares
cleanup "n" key. I don't use ?/ 
cleanup the "/" key. I don't use }
cleanup "m" key. remove *
cleanup "k" key. remove +
