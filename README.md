# Piantor 42 keys layout

![](https://github.com/jdvfx/piantor42/blob/main/piantor_layout.png)

> Goal:
- keep the layout as standard as possible, </br>
making it easy to switch between 42keys and a fullsize or laptop keyboard.
- minimal learning curve (qwerty, no home-row mod, no auto-shift, no tap-dance)
- remove duplicated keys (almost done)
- remove unused keys: capslock/scroll lock/pause
- move F-keys on a layer. Realistically, I only ever use F1.
- arrow keys in Vim position (hjkl)
- brackets are in logical priority order: (){}[]</br>
<code>function(){
    array[]
}</code></br>
- -+= are inline for easy coding += -=
- "delete" is a combo, much safer than a single key press.
- "Enter" can be pressed with the right thumb or pinkie

> keys in same position as on a standard layout: </br>
- bottom to top: ctrl, shift, tab </br>
- left to right: crtl, super, space </br>
- top row: numbers and corresponding symbols </br>
- backspace and enter </br>
- 3 keys on the right side of "M" </br>

> to do:
- add "insert" key? used very rarely in 2 softwares </br>
- cleanup "n" key. I don't use ?/  </br>
- cleanup the "/" key. I don't use } </br>
- cleanup "m" key. remove * </br>
- cleanup "k" key. remove + </br>
